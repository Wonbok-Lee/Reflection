<h1>Reflection</h1>

<p id = "paragraph">What is a responsive web? Simply put, web pages are automatically resized according to device type. It’s a web that’s sized to fit any environment, making it user-friendly.
It provides users with an optimized environment for a particular device with only one HTML source. Mobile First is a must for the responsive web. Mobile First is a method of
designing and programming a mobile device before a PC when designing a web. This concept was created by the increased use of mobile devices such as tablet PCs and smart phones,
which led to more mobile web users than regular web users. The key to mobile first is to see the constraints of mobile as an opportunity to focus. Mobile constraints can be divided
into three main categories. Screen size for mobile devices,  network speed and quality, and mode used.<br><br>
    
Through these three constraints, the Web determines that it has unnecessary elements (function/format/decoration) in its mobile web. Minimizing unnecessary elements, the mobile web 
indicates what the site really needs to offer and what features it has to offer. It provides users with a web that’s easy to use and fast to process. One of the most representative 
of them is to reduce the regular web menu to one button and show the content from the first screen.<br><br> 

I used viewport meta tag to set the viewport of my page. I also used max-width property to make my images scale nicely to fit any browser size. Lastly, I used ‘vw’ unit to set text 
size, so that it will follow the size of the browser window.<br><br> 

I learned that building web apps for different devices is a hard work. My website is very simple, therefore it didn’t require much work to make it responsive. However, usually web 
apps are much more complicated and it would require a lot of time and effort to make it responsive. I am looking forward to learn more about it next semester when I take WEB322.
